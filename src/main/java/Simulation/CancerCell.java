/**
 *This is a cancer cell. It is the most complex cell as it can attack tissue or immune cells, or grow into a dead cell.
 * For attacking tissue, it is a 1 hit replace it with a dead cell.
 * Immune cells are cooler. Each hit from a cancer cell lowers its strength by 1. When an immune cell reaches 0 strength
 * it dies!
 *
 * It has a priority of action. If it can grow, it will grow. If it can kill a tissue cell, it will do that. Why?
 * Easiest way to grow is to kill a week tissue cell. If no other option, will attack immune cells. Path of
 * least resistance to growing basically.
 *
 * Growing means turning a dead cell into a CancerCell.
